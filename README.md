Code of "Shap Scores for Neural Network Classifiers: Black-Box vs. Open-Box Circuit Compilation", written by Jorge E. Le√≥n. Feel free to use it as you please üëç

This code is thought to be used on Google Colab. Modifications should be made to be installed on other computers (specially the ones with an OS different from Linux).

A big thanks goes to Arthur Choi, Andy Shih & Norbert Manthey for their respective repositories, which were key to the development of this code.
